"""Unicode-safe cv2 image IO (issue #17).

``cv2.imread`` / ``cv2.imwrite`` pass the path to the platform C runtime, which
on Windows uses the narrow (ANSI) code-page API and therefore fails on paths
containing non-ASCII characters (Chinese, Cyrillic, ...). The symptom is a
``can't open/read file`` warning and a ``None`` decode even though the file
exists.

These wrappers route through numpy buffers instead: ``np.fromfile`` /
``ndarray.tofile`` open the path in Python (full Unicode), and
``cv2.imdecode`` / ``cv2.imencode`` do the codec work. The decoded/encoded
bytes are byte-for-byte identical to ``imread`` / ``imwrite``. On macOS/Linux
cv2 already accepts UTF-8 paths, so the wrappers are behavior-neutral there.

cv2/numpy are imported lazily inside the functions so importing this module
stays cheap in a bare environment (matching the rest of the package).
